/*
In JavaScript, the fundamental difference in how this is handled between arrow functions and normal functions comes down to their binding behavior. A normal function's this is dynamically bound based on how it is called, while an arrow function's this is lexically bound, inheriting the value from its enclosing scope when it is created. example

const obj = {
  name:'Rohit',
  arrowChangeName: (name) => {
    this.name=name

    this.name=name
    console.log(this)
  }
}

obj.arrowChangeName('mohit')
console.log(obj.name)
obj.normalChangeName('mohit')
console.log(obj.name)

/*
Step 1: obj.arrowChangeName('mohit')
The arrowChangeName method is an arrow function.
Arrow functions do not bind their own this. Instead, they inherit the this value from their enclosing lexical (parent) scope.
In this case, the arrow function is defined in the top-level scope (the global scope), where this refers to the global object.
Executing this.name = name will create a new name property on the global object (e.g., the window object in browsers or global in Node.js), and assign it the value 'mohit'. It will not modify obj.name.
console.log(this) will log the global object, which now has a name property. 

Step 2: console.log(obj.name)
This line prints the name property of the obj object.
The arrow function in the previous step did not change obj.name, so it still holds its original value. 

Step 3: obj.normalChangeName('mohit')
The normalChangeName method is a standard function.
When a normal function is invoked as a method of an object (using the dot notation obj.normalChangeName()), its this value is dynamically bound to the object that owns the methodâ€”in this case, the obj object.
Executing this.name = name will change the name property of the obj object to 'mohit'.
console.log(this) will log the obj object itself.

Step 4: console.log(obj.name)
This line prints the name property of the obj object again.
This time, the value has been changed by the normal function call. */
