console.log("Yatharth")

/*
1. console.log() literally means to "log" a message to the "console". It's a command primarily used by developers to see what's happening inside their code.

-------------- Breakdown of the Command --------------

Think of console.log() as a two-part instruction:

    console: This is a built-in object in JavaScript that acts as a gateway to your web browser's or terminal's debugging console. It's like having a control panel for developer output.

    .log(): This is a method (a function that belongs to an object) that you call on the console object. Its specific job is to take whatever you put inside the parentheses and print it out as a standard, informational message. The term "log" is used in the sense of creating a record or an entry, much like a captain's log on a ship.

So, when we write console.log('Hello, World!');, you're telling the JavaScript engine: "Access the developer console and log the text 'Hello, World!' to it."



-------------- Why It's Used --------------

1. console.log() is the most fundamental tool for debugging. As a learner, you'll use it constantly to:

2. Check Variable Values: See what value a variable holds at a certain point in your code.

3. Confirm Code Execution: Verify that a specific line or block of code is actually running.

4. Inspect Objects and Arrays: See the contents of more complex data structures.

5. While it prints to the terminal in environments like Node.js, in a web browser, it prints to the Developer Console, which you can typically open by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I.
