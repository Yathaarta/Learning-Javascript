            console.log(data.login);
        }
    }
    xhr.send();

//when request is sent the status code change btw 0 ,1, 2, 3, 4 state which represent unsent, opened, headers_recieved, loading, done, status code can be seen using readyState function and state code tracking can be done using onreadystate which takes a function value (the way u wish to track state code) , when state change it is tracked 1 is start point so it is not tracked the changing of state on 2, 3, 4 is tracked
